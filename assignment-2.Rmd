# Overview

# Setup

Setup the environment by loading the `datasets` library.  Once it has been loaded, just take a quick look through it to find out what is in the data.

```{r}
# Load the data sets
library(datasets)

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Copy the data for internal use
data <- ToothGrowth

```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that the data has been loaded, let's take a look through it to get a good feeling for what is in it.

```{r}
# Look at the structure of the data
str(data)

# Look at the top few rows of the data
head(data)

# Look at the summary of the data
summary(data)
```

# Initial Analysis

Look 

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = supp, y = len, group = supp)) +
    
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = supp)) +
    labs(
        x = 'Supplement',
        y = 'Tooth Length',
        title = 'The Effect of Supplements on Tooth Length'
    ) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set2')
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = dose, y = len, group = factor(dose))) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(dose))) +
    labs(
        x = 'Dosage',
        y = 'Tooth Length',
        title = 'The Effect of Doses on Tooth Length'
    ) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Set2')
```

# Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Test

```{r}
t.test(len~supp, data=data)
```

```{r}
t.test(len~dose, data=data[data$dose==0.5|data$dose==1.0,])
```

```{r}
t.test(len~dose, data=data[data$dose==2.0|data$dose==1.0,])
```
