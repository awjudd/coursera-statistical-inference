# Overview

# Simulations

Start by defining some constants that we will be using throughout the analysis.

```{r}
# Set the simulation seed value so that the data is reproducible
set.seed(256)

# Setup the variables that we need
simulation.random_uniform <- 40
simulation.rate <- 0.2
simulation.count <- 1000
```

Now that the environment is set up, let's run the simulation.

```{r}
# Generate the sample data
simulation.data <- matrix(
    rexp(
        simulation.random_uniform * simulation.count,
        simulation.rate
    ),
    simulation.count
)
```


# Questions

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.

With the simulation data present, we need to compare the actual versus the theoretical.

```{r}
# Mean = 1 / lambda
theoretical.mean <- 1 / simulation.rate

# Calculate the mean of each row
row.mean <- apply(
    simulation.data, 
    1, 
    mean
)

# Calculate the actual mean
actual.mean <- mean(row.mean)
```

- Theoretical Mean: **``r theoretical.mean ``**
- Actual Mean: **``r actual.mean ``**

2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

```{r}
# Variance = ((1 / lambda) ^ 2) / n
theoretical.variance <- ( (1 / simulation.rate) ^ 2) / simulation.random_uniform

# Calculate the actual variance
actual.variance <- var(row.mean)
```

- Theoretical Variance: **``r theoretical.variance ``**
- Actual Variance: **``r actual.variance ``**

3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

```{r}
hist(row.mean, xlab = 'Sample Mean', main='Frequency of Sample Means', breaks = 20)
abline(v = actual.mean, col = 'green', lwd = 1)
abline(v = theoretical.mean, col = 'blue', lwd = 1)
```
